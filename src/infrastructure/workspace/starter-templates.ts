This folder is your **local-first** Second Brain: notes, tasks, and projects live here as Markdown files.
A small SQLite index under \`.second-brain/\` makes search and dashboards fast; the **files stay the source of truth**.

Each entity lives in a small folder package with \`index.md\` as the canonical note; YAML front matter under the \`second_brain\` key holds stable \`id\`, \`kind\`, \`slug\`, and \`status\`.

## PARA (how things are grouped)

- **Projects** — short efforts with a clear outcome.
- **Areas** — ongoing responsibilities (health, career, family).
- **Resources** — reference material you may reuse.
- **Archive** — inactive items you might bring back later.

## CODE (how work flows)

- **Capture** — get ideas into the inbox quickly.
- **Organize** — move items into areas, projects, and tasks.
- **Distill** — refine notes into durable ideas.
- **Express** — turn knowledge into action (tasks, writing, decisions).

## Next steps

1. Glance at \`01-areas/\` and \`06-notes/\` for the included examples.
2. Add something to \`00-inbox/\` whenever inspiration hits.
3. Run \`second-brain-os doctor\` to confirm paths when the CLI is fully wired up.

You do not need to master every concept on day one — capture first, organize second.

This is an **example area** — a long-lived bucket for life domains like health, family, or hobbies.

Link projects, tasks, and notes here as you go. You can rename this folder or add more areas anytime.

Your Second Brain is a **working system**, not a filing cabinet.

- **Inbox** is for quick captures before you know where they belong.
- **Areas** anchor ongoing responsibility.
- **Projects** finish; **areas** continue.

When in doubt, capture now and organize in a weekly review.

Drop raw thoughts here before you sort them into areas, projects, or tasks.

You can delete this capture folder once you have your own rhythm.
